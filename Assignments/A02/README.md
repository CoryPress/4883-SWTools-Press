# Mockaroo

[Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) is random data generator that can generate over 100 types of mock input data. They have everything from numbers and names all the way to things like grocery items, urls, IP adresses and all of this can be formated into formats like sql insert statements, excel, or a custonm text file. It can generate up to 1,000 data values for free and then up to 10 million if your willing to pay.

I choose Mockaroo because you can get so caught up trying to come up with fake input data when trying to test a project and end up wasting a large amount of time. However, with Mockaroo all you have to do is pick the type of data you want and get up to 1000 sets of input for free.
